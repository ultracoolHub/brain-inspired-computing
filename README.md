## Abstract
The continuous development of artificial intelligence has a profound impact on biomedical research and other fields.Brain-inspired computing is an important intersection of multimodal technology and biomedical field. This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied in human-computer interaction for brain-inspired computing, tracking their evolution, application value, challenges, and potential research trajectories. First, the basic concepts and development history are reviewed, and their evolution is divided into two stages: recent machine learning and current deep learning, emphasizing the importance of each stage in the research state of human-computer interaction for brain-inspired computing. In addition, the latest progress and key techniques of deep learning in different tasks of human-computer interaction for brain-inspired computing are introduced from six perspectives. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in making full use of its capabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of human-computer interaction for brain-inspired computing models based on machine learning and deep learning, highlighting their potential in various applications and providing a valuable reference for future academic research.
